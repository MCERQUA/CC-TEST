# Common Issues and Solutions

## Netlify Deployment Failures

### Layout Reference Errors

**Issue:** Netlify deployment fails with error: "You're trying to use a layout that does not exist: service-page.njk (undefined)"

**Root Cause:** Service files are referencing `layout: service-page.njk` but the actual layout file is located at `src/_includes/layouts/service-page.njk`. In Eleventy, when referencing layouts from subdirectories within the `_includes` folder, you need to include the full path.

**Solution:** Update layout references from `service-page.njk` to `layouts/service-page.njk`

**Quick Fix Script:** Run `node fix-layouts.js` to automatically fix all affected files.

**Files Commonly Affected:**
- All service files in `src/services/` subdirectories
- Any new service pages created

**Prevention:** When creating new service pages, always use the full layout path: `layout: layouts/service-page.njk`
