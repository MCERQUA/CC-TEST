# AI Coding Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides specific guidelines for AI assistants working on the ICA website. Following these rules will prevent common errors and ensure consistent, high-quality code.

## Critical Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

### 1. Layout References ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
```yaml
# ‚úÖ ALWAYS USE THIS FORMAT
layout: layouts/service-page.njk

# ‚ùå NEVER USE THIS (causes deployment failure)
layout: service-page.njk
```

**Why:** Eleventy requires full path when layouts are in subdirectories.

### 2. Template Dependencies
Before including any template, verify it exists:

```bash
# Check sections exist
ls src/_includes/sections/

# Check components exist  
ls src/_includes/components/
```

**Common includes that MUST exist:**
- `sections/service-hero.njk`
- `sections/cta.njk`
- `sections/testimonials.njk`
- `components/benefits-grid.njk`
- `components/process-steps.njk`

### 3. Duplicate Permalink Prevention
- Never create multiple files that output to the same URL
- Check existing files before creating new ones
- Use unique permalinks or remove duplicates

### 4. Required Frontmatter Fields
Every service page MUST include:
```yaml
layout: layouts/service-page.njk  # Full path required
title: "Service Name"
subtitle: "Brief description"
meta_description: "SEO description"
```

## File Creation Guidelines

### Service Pages
**Location:** `src/services/[category]/service-name.njk`

**Template:**
```yaml
---
layout: layouts/service-page.njk
title: "Service Name"
subtitle: "Brief service description"
meta_description: "SEO-optimized description under 160 characters"

```

### Blog Posts
**Location:** `src/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

**Template:**
```yaml
---

# ‚ùå WRONG - Missing path
layout: service-page.njk

# ‚ùå WRONG - Incorrect path
layout: service-page/service-page.njk

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
layout: layouts/service-page.njk
```

### Template Includes
```nunjucks
<!-- ‚ùå WRONG - Non-existent file -->
{% include "sections/non-existent-section.njk" %}

<!-- ‚ùå WRONG - Incorrect path -->
{% include "section/service-hero.njk" %}

npm run build
```

### Browser Testing
1. Open http://localhost:8080
2. Navigate to new/modified pages
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test all interactive elements

### Pre-Deployment Validation
1. All builds complete successfully
2. No console errors in browser
3. All images load properly
4. Internal links work correctly
5. SEO elements are present

## Problem-Solving Approach

### When Encountering Errors
1. **Read the error message carefully**
