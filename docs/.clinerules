# Cline Rules and Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
- **Project:** ICA Website (Insulation Contractors of Arizona)
- **Framework:** Eleventy (11ty) static site generator
- **Deployment:** Netlify
- **Current Directory:** e:/1-WORKING-NEW/Mike/AZFOAM/ICA-Website

## Critical Layout Rules

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Layout References
When creating or editing service pages, ALWAYS use the full layout path:
- ✅ Correct: `layout: layouts/service-page.njk`
- ❌ Incorrect: `layout: service-page.njk`

**Why:** Eleventy requires the full path when layouts are in subdirectories within `_includes/`

**Files Affected:** All files in `src/services/` subdirectories

### Layout File Locations
- Service pages: `src/_includes/layouts/service-page.njk`
- Regular pages: `src/_includes/layouts/page.njk`
- Service categories: `src/_includes/layouts/service-category.njk`

## File Structure Guidelines

### Service Files Organization
```
src/services/
├── residential/
├── commercial/
├── industrial/
└── agricultural/
```

### Layout Files Organization
```
src/_includes/
├── layouts/
│   ├── page.njk
│   ├── service-page.njk
│   └── service-category.njk
├── components/
└── sections/
```

## Common Issues Prevention

### 1. Layout Reference Errors
- **Issue:** Netlify deployment fails with layout not found errors
- **Prevention:** Always use full layout paths
- **Quick Fix:** Run `node fix-layouts.js`

### 2. New Service Page Creation
When creating new service pages:
1. Use correct layout reference: `layout: layouts/service-page.njk`
2. Follow existing frontmatter structure
3. Include required fields: title, subtitle, meta_description, benefits, process

## Deployment Guidelines

### Before Pushing Changes
1. Test locally with `npm run dev`
2. Verify layout references are correct
3. Check for any console errors
4. Ensure all required frontmatter fields are present
