## The Critical Importance of Proper Cold Storage Insulation

### Arizona's Extreme Challenge

Cold storage facilities in Arizona face the most extreme temperature differentials in the nation:

- **Temperature Differential**: Up to 155¬∞F difference between freezer interior (-40¬∞F) and Arizona summer exterior (115¬∞F)
- **Moisture Migration**: Extreme temperature gradients create powerful vapor drive
- **Energy Demands**: Cooling costs can exceed $100,000 annually for inadequately insulated facilities
- **Structural Stress**: Thermal cycling causes expansion/contraction damage

### Consequences of Poor Insulation

- **Ice Buildup**: Moisture infiltration creates dangerous ice formations
- **Product Loss**: Temperature fluctuations compromise product quality
- **Equipment Failure**: Compressors overwork and fail prematurely
- **Structural Damage**: Moisture causes rot, corrosion, and panel delamination
- **Compliance Violations**: Failing to maintain required temperatures

## Our Cold Storage Insulation Solutions

### Closed-Cell Spray Foam - The Gold Standard

For cold storage applications, closed-cell spray foam is the only choice:

- **R-Value**: 6.5 per inch - highest available
- **Vapor Barrier**: Complete moisture protection at 1.5" thickness
- **Seamless Application**: No joints or gaps for thermal bridging
- **Structural Enhancement**: Adds rigidity to walls and ceilings
- **Long-Term Performance**: Maintains R-value for 25+ years
