# Blown-In Insulation: Smart Choice for Arizona Homes

## Why Choose Blown-In Insulation?

Blown-in insulation offers the perfect balance of performance, affordability, and installation speed for Arizona homeowners. Using specialized equipment, we can fill your attic, walls, and hard-to-reach spaces with premium insulation material, creating a seamless thermal barrier against our extreme climate.

## Types of Blown-In Insulation We Install

### Fiberglass Blown-In Insulation

**Best for**: Attics, open wall cavities, and moisture-prone areas

Fiberglass blown-in insulation provides excellent thermal performance with superior moisture resistance. Made from recycled glass and sand, it's naturally non-combustible and won't support mold growth - crucial advantages in Arizona's varied climate.

**Key Benefits**:
- **R-Value**: R-2.5 per inch
- **Longevity**: 20-30 year lifespan without settling
- **Safety**: Non-combustible and non-toxic
- **Moisture**: Won't absorb water or support mold

### Cellulose Blown-In Insulation

**Best for**: Dense-pack applications, sound control, and eco-conscious homeowners

Made from recycled newspaper treated with fire retardants, cellulose offers superior R-value per inch and excellent air sealing properties. It's our most environmentally friendly option while delivering outstanding performance.

**Key Benefits**:
- **R-Value**: R-3.7 per inch
- **Eco-Friendly**: 85% recycled content
- **Air Sealing**: Fills small gaps and cracks
- **Sound Control**: Superior noise reduction

## Application Areas

### Attic Insulation
The most common application for blown-in insulation. We can quickly cover large attic spaces to achieve R-38 to R-60, creating a thick blanket of protection against Arizona's brutal summer heat.

### Wall Retrofit
Using the dense-pack method, we can insulate existing walls through small access holes, dramatically improving your home's thermal performance without major renovation.

### Floor/Crawl Space
Blown-in insulation effectively insulates above unheated spaces, reducing drafts and improving comfort in rooms above garages or crawl spaces.

## The Professional Installation Process

### 1. Thorough Preparation
- Seal air leaks and gaps
- Install proper ventilation baffles
- Protect HVAC equipment and living spaces
- Mark target depth indicators

### 2. Expert Application
- Use professional-grade blowing equipment
- Ensure even distribution and proper density
- Achieve specified R-value throughout
- Pay special attention to edges and corners

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Verify depth and coverage
- Check for settling or gaps
- Document installation with photos
- Provide warranty certification

## Cost Comparison

### Typical Project Costs
- **1,000 sq ft attic (R-38)**: $750-1,350
- **1,500 sq ft attic (R-49)**: $1,275-2,025
- **2,000 sq ft attic (R-60)**: $2,100-3,300

### Factors Affecting Price
- Current insulation condition
- Accessibility of installation area
- Target R-value requirements
- Material selection (fiberglass vs cellulose)

## Why Professional Installation Matters

### DIY Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Uneven Coverage**: Creates hot spots and energy loss
- **Improper Density**: Reduces effective R-value
- **Blocked Ventilation**: Can cause moisture problems
- **Safety Hazards**: Extreme attic heat and material handling

### Our Professional Advantages
- **Certified Technicians**: Trained in proper installation techniques
- **Commercial Equipment**: Ensures proper material distribution
- **Safety Protocols**: Full protective gear and procedures
- **Warranty Protection**: Manufacturer-backed installation

## Energy Savings & ROI

### Expected Performance
- **Summer Cooling**: 20-30% reduction in AC runtime
- **Winter Heating**: 10-15% reduction in heating costs
- **Comfort**: More consistent temperatures throughout home
- **HVAC Life**: Extended equipment lifespan

### Return on Investment
Most homeowners see full payback in 2-4 years through:
- Lower monthly energy bills
- Reduced HVAC maintenance
- Available utility rebates
- Increased home value

## Maintenance & Longevity

### Fiberglass Blown-In
- Maintains R-value for 20-30 years
- No settling when properly installed
- Resistant to moisture and pests
- No maintenance required

### Cellulose Blown-In
- Settles 10-20% over time (we account for this)
