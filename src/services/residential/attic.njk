faqs:
  - question: How hot do Arizona attics really get?
    answer: During summer, Arizona attics regularly reach 150-160¬∞F, creating extreme stress on your cooling system and making upper floors unbearably hot. Proper attic insulation creates a thermal barrier that dramatically reduces heat transfer into your living space.
  - question: What R-value do I need for my Arizona attic?
    answer: The Department of Energy recommends R-38 to R-60 for Arizona attics. However, the type of insulation matters as much as the R-value. We'll assess your specific situation and recommend the optimal solution for your home and budget.
  - question: Should I remove old insulation before adding new?
    answer: It depends on the condition of existing insulation. If it's contaminated, water-damaged, or pest-infested, removal is recommended. Otherwise, we can often add new insulation on top, saving you money while improving performance.
  - question: How long does attic insulation installation take?
    answer: Most attic insulation projects are completed in one day. Larger homes or those requiring old insulation removal may take 2-3 days. We'll provide a detailed timeline during your free assessment.
  - question: Will new attic insulation really lower my energy bills?
    answer: Yes! Our customers typically see 30-50% reductions in cooling costs. In Arizona's extreme climate, proper attic insulation is one of the most cost-effective home improvements you can make.

# Arizona's Attic Insulation Experts

## The 160¬∞F Challenge Your Attic Faces

Your attic is ground zero in the battle against Arizona heat. When outdoor temperatures hit 115¬∞F, your attic becomes a superheated furnace reaching 160¬∞F or higher. This extreme heat radiates down into your living space, making your AC work overtime and driving up energy costs.

## Why Proper Attic Insulation Matters in Arizona

### The Hidden Cost of Poor Attic Insulation

- **Energy Loss**: Up to 40% of your cooling energy escapes through an under-insulated attic
- **Comfort Issues**: Hot ceilings, uneven temperatures, and stuffy upper floors
- **HVAC Strain**: Your AC runs constantly, leading to premature failure
- **High Bills**: Arizona homeowners pay some of the highest cooling costs in the nation

#### Spray Foam Insulation (R-6.5 per inch)
- **Best for**: Maximum energy efficiency and air sealing
- **Benefits**: Superior R-value, moisture barrier, permanent solution
- **Ideal when**: You want the absolute best performance

#### Blown-In Fiberglass (R-2.5 per inch)

## Investment and Returns

### Typical Attic Insulation Costs
