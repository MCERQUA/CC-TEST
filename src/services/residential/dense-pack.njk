faqs:
  - question: "Will dense pack work in my older home?"
    answer: "Yes! Dense pack is ideal for older homes built before modern insulation standards. It's especially effective in balloon-frame and platform-frame construction common in pre-1980s Arizona homes."
  - question: "How long does dense pack installation take?"
    answer: "Most homes can be completed in 1-2 days. A typical 2,000 sq ft home takes about 8-10 hours for installation, plus additional time for patching and painting."
  - question: "Is dense pack installation messy?"
    answer: "Our professional installation process includes comprehensive dust control and cleanup. We use specialized equipment with HEPA filtration and protect your home throughout the process."
  - question: "What's the difference between dense pack and regular blown-in?"
    answer: "Dense pack is installed at 3.5 lbs/ft続 density versus 1.5 lbs/ft続 for standard blown-in. This higher density prevents settling, provides better R-value, and creates superior air sealing."
  - question: "Can dense pack be installed without removing drywall?"
    answer: "Yes! That's the main advantage. We drill small access holes that are professionally patched after installation. It's 60-70% less expensive than removing and replacing drywall."
  - question: "Which material is better - cellulose or fiberglass?"
    answer: "Both work well. Cellulose is eco-friendly with good sound absorption. Fiberglass has higher R-value per inch and better moisture resistance. We'll recommend based on your specific needs."
