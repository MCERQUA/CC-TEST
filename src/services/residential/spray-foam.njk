faqs:
  - question: "Which spray foam type is best for Arizona's extreme heat?"
    answer: "Closed-cell spray foam typically performs best in Arizona's extreme conditions. It maintains its R-6.5 per inch rating even at temperatures exceeding 160°F and provides superior moisture protection during monsoon season. Open-cell can be cost-effective for interior applications or budget-conscious projects."
  - question: "How does spray foam handle monsoon moisture?"
    answer: "Closed-cell spray foam acts as an excellent vapor barrier, preventing moisture intrusion during Arizona's monsoon season. This protection is crucial for maintaining indoor air quality and preventing mold or mildew issues that can develop with other insulation types."
  - question: "What's the ROI timeline for spray foam in Arizona?"
    answer: "Most Arizona homeowners see a 3-5 year payback period on spray foam installation through energy savings alone. With summer cooling costs representing 60-70% of annual energy bills, the savings can be substantial—often $500-800+ annually for average homes."
  - question: "How long does spray foam last in Arizona conditions?"
    answer: "Quality spray foam installation typically lasts 25+ years in Arizona conditions, significantly longer than traditional insulation which may need replacement every 15-20 years due to settling and performance degradation."
  - question: "What rebates are available for spray foam in Arizona?"
    answer: "APS, SRP, and TEP all offer energy efficiency rebates that may apply to spray foam installation. We help customers navigate available incentives and can provide documentation needed for rebate applications."
  - question: "Is spray foam worth the investment in Arizona?"
    answer: "Absolutely. With energy savings of 30-50% and a typical ROI of 3-5 years, spray foam pays for itself while providing superior comfort. The extreme heat performance alone makes it worthwhile for Arizona homeowners."
