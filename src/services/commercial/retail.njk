faqs:
  - question: "How does insulation improve retail customer experience?"
    answer: "Proper insulation maintains consistent temperatures throughout your retail space, eliminates hot/cold spots near windows and doors, reduces outside noise, and creates a more comfortable shopping environment that encourages customers to stay longer."
  - question: "What's the best insulation for retail spaces?"
    answer: "Closed-cell spray foam is ideal for retail spaces as it provides superior thermal performance, acts as a sound barrier, and creates an air seal that prevents dust and allergens from entering the space."
  - question: "Can you install insulation without disrupting business?"
    answer: "Yes, we offer flexible scheduling including nights and weekends. Most retail insulation projects can be completed in sections to minimize disruption to your business operations."
  - question: "How much can retail businesses save on energy costs?"
    answer: "Most retail spaces see 25-40% reduction in HVAC costs after proper insulation. The exact savings depend on your current insulation, building size, and operating hours."
