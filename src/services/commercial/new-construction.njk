faqs:
  - question: "When should insulation be installed in new construction?"
    answer: "Insulation is typically installed after framing, plumbing, and electrical rough-ins are complete but before drywall. For spray foam, we coordinate with other trades to ensure proper sequencing."
  - question: "What insulation meets Arizona building codes?"
    answer: "Arizona requires R-38 to R-49 in attics and R-13 to R-20 in walls depending on climate zone. We ensure all installations meet or exceed current building codes and can provide compliance documentation."
  - question: "Can you work with our construction schedule?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We understand construction timelines and coordinate closely with general contractors. Our crews can mobilize quickly and complete installations on schedule."
  - question: "Do you provide insulation specifications for bidding?"
    answer: "Yes, we provide detailed specifications, R-value calculations, and material data sheets for your bidding process. We also offer value engineering suggestions to optimize performance and cost."
  - question: "What warranty do you provide for new construction?"
    answer: "We provide comprehensive warranties that align with construction defect statutes. Spray foam installations include 10-year warranties on material and workmanship."
