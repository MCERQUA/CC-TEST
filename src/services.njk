                        <p><strong>R-Value: R-6.5 to R-7 per inch</strong> - The highest performing insulation for extreme heat</p>
                        <p>Closed-cell spray foam is our top recommendation for Arizona homes. It maintains its insulating properties even when attic temperatures exceed 160°F, provides a complete vapor barrier for monsoon season, and adds structural strength to your building envelope.</p>

                            <li>Superior air sealing eliminates 40% of energy loss</li>
                            <li>Moisture barrier protection during monsoons</li>
                            <li>25-30+ year lifespan in Arizona conditions</li>
